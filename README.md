# BudgetWise

## Point of attention

The primary goal of this project is to put into practice the software development knowledge gained so far.

It is also an objective to develop the application enabling the easy implementation of new features, so that the software modeling will describe or even detail features that may not be implemented.

The software design phases will have periodic and not very well documented commits (I find it useful to follow the line of reasoning, time invested and discarded ideas).

For development I will try to implement it in a development branch seeking to follow good development practices.

## About the Application

BudgetWise was created to meet the need for organized personal and family financial management. It enables the tracking, monitoring, and analysis of all financial transactions, providing a clear view of current financial status while delivering useful notifications and feedback to maintain financial health.

The app allows users to record income and expenses in a dynamic and intuitive way, categorizing transactions by type. This detailed recording of financial information—such as descriptions, amounts, and dates of purchases—forms the backbone of the app’s statistical and reporting features. With BudgetWise, users can answer questions like: "How much am I spending on entertainment?" or "What’s my current balance?" and track these data trends over time.

### Features and Highlights

BudgetWise goes beyond a simple tracking tool, offering a robust experience that enables users to:

- **Detailed transaction analysis**: Categorize and describe expenses and income by dates and amounts for easy tracking.
- **Financial statistics and insights**: Consolidated budget overview, with charts and reports that facilitate historical analysis and help identify spending patterns.
- **Personalization and intelligent feedback**: The application structure was designed to potentially include personalized feedback, enabling a future integration of an LLM-based agent to provide automated insights based on user data, offering guidance towards financial goals or spending adjustments.

With BudgetWise, personal finance management is accessible to everyone, whether for couples looking to organize expenses or individuals seeking a comprehensive and personalized view of their financial health. These and many other features make BudgetWise an essential tool for financial management!
